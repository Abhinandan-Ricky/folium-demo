# folium-demo

A simple Flask app that demonstrates some basic Folium functionality using the WMATA API.

A Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) goes into more depth, with more examples using GeoJSON and the Walk Score API.

## Environment

An environment is provided in `environment.yml`. Using Conda you can run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a virtual environment with all the dependencies for both the Flask app and Jupyter notebook.
