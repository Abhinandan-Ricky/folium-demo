# folium-demo

A barebones Flask app that demonstrates some basic Folium functionality using the WMATA API.

A Jupyter notebook (`demo.ipynb`) goes into more depth, with more examples using GeoJSON and the Walk Score API. An HTML version of the notebook is available as `demo.html`.

This repo is meant to showcase possibilities, not best practices. Don't judge me.

## Environment

An environment is provided in `environment.yml`. Using Conda you can run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create a virtual environment with all the dependencies for both the Flask app and Jupyter notebook.
